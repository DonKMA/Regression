This is an interactive regression line. The data set is automatically generated.
You can shift vertically and rotate the line to change the slope and the y-intercept.
Then you can view the total error in the green window below.
Observe that the total error is minimized when your regression line coincides with the line of best fit.
The equation of the best fit is prited on the top of the chart.
